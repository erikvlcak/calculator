# calculator

Perfectly working calculator with all basic operations in a colorful design. Nothing more, nothing less!

Main features:
- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division. You can also add a decimal point, as well as change negative number into positive and vice versa.
- Calculator can be operated either by mouse or by keyboard. Enter or "=" key acts as "=" button, Backspace or "d" key acts as DEL button, Delete or "c" button acts ad C button. Regex test allows only numbers and selected operators to be registered.
- Upon entering first number and hitting an operator, they are stored in upper row of the display. Now you have to enter second number and generate a result. 
- Results of an operation is generated either by hitting "=" button or by starting new operation once both number and an operator have been entered.
- Reset whole operation by hitting C, delete current number by hitting DEL. Once all numbers have been DELeted, it turns into 0.
- Dividing by 0 generates funny result.
- Only one decimal point per number is allowed.
- Usable also on mobile devices - dimensions scale with viewport to an extent.

Main goals:
- Practice woring with arrays and array methods, number methods, objects, keyboard DOM events and regex test.
- Practice flexbox and grid layouts.
- Practice variables management and complex system of conditionals.
